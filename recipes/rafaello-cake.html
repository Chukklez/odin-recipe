        <h3 class="container-header">Cooking Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Bottom:</b> Set the oven at 170 degrees celcius and line a springform pan about 24 in diameter with
                parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Roast almonds in a dry pan and let cool for a while. Grind the almonds with a food processor or in a
                blender.</li>
            <li> Separate egg yolks and egg whites. Whisk the egg whites to a stiff foam. Add the sugar, a little at a
                time. Whisk until you get a shiny meringue.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg yolks a little lightly in a bowl and mix into the meringue.</li>
            <li>Carefully turn down the ground almonds and wheat flour and stir gently to a smooth batter./li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the mold and bake in the middle of the oven for about 20-25 minutes. (Do not open
                the oven while the cake is baking) Check with a test strip if the cake is completely dry. Allow to cool
                completely before dividing it into three parts.</li>
            <li><b>Filling:</b> Roughly chop the chocolate and melt in a water bath (in a bowl over a saucepan with a
                little boiling water) together with the condensed milk. Then let cool.</li>
            <li>Whisk cream cheese with vanilla sugar. </li>
            <li>Add the melted chocolate while whisking, whisk to a smooth and fine cream, finally mix in the coconut
                flakes and stir everything.</li>
            <li>Whip cream in another bowl to a fairly firm consistency. Then mix the whipped cream with the cream
                cheese batter, a little at a time</li>
            <li><b>Assemble the cake:</b> Divide the cake base into 3 parts. Cut 4 small baking sheets and place on the
                cake tray in which the cake is to be mounted (to avoid smudges). Lay the first base and brush with a
                little coconut milk. Spread on one layer with filling, put on the next do the same. Place the last base
                and spread on the filling on top and around the entire cake. Put cake in the fridge for at least 2
                hours.</li>
            <li><b>Chocolate ganache:</b> Chop the chocolate into smaller pieces. Boil cream in a saucepan and pour over
                the chocolate, stirring until all the chocolate is melted.</li>
            <li>Pour over the chocolate ganache on the cake and smooth with a tablespoon or palette.</li>
            <li>Cover with coconut flakes, around the entire cake. Decorate with raffaello balls.
                The cake tastes best when it has been in the fridge for 1-2 days.</li>

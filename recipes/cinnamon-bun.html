    <p class="desc">This is my very best recipe for cinnamon buns that really get really fluffy and tasty! I absolutely love baking cinnamon buns. If you have not tried baking buns with wheat flour special before, I can really recommend it. The buns are really fluffy and a lovely texture.</p>

    <h3 class="container-header">Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crumble the yeast in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Warm the milk to 30-35 degrees, rather a little colder than too hot and let the dough take a little extra time instead.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk into the bowl and stir until the yeast dissolves. Add butter, sugar, cardamom and salt.</li>
        <li>Add almost all the flour, save a little for the baking. Work the dough for 10 minutes in a machine or double by hand until it releases from the edges of the bowl and can be touched without getting stuck on the fingers.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rise for 30-40 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir together all the ingredients for the filling.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough into a rectangle and spread the filling evenly all over. Fold the dough along the long side.</li>
        <li>Cut about 1.5 cm wide strips of the dough that you twist, then spin to a spin and put the end underneath. Place on sheets of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cover the plates with baking sheets and leave to ferment for 30-40 minutes. Set the oven to 250 degrees.</li>
        <li>Brush with beaten egg and sprinkle with powdered sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the middle of the oven for about 6-8 minutes until they are golden both on top and under the bun.</li>
        <li>Place the buns on a wire rack and allow to cool under a cloth.</li>
    </ol>

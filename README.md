# basic-recipe-site

<h1>Basic overview</h1>
Made a basic HTML site for recipes
Made an assets folder for the picture assets that will be linked to aswell as a recipes folder for all the separate recipe webpages.
In the index webpage I linked to all the recipes in the recipe folder and put those in an unordered list so that they're in a list instead of just one after another.

<h2>Description of the recipe page layout</h2>
In the recipes pages I used the identical layout of "<h1> element" for the name of the recipe followed by an "<img> element" who's link leads to the "assets folder". After that there's the name of recipe in a "<h2> element" followed by a paragraphed description in a "<p> element".
Below that there are ingredients for a set number of portions in an unordered list with the "<ul> and <li> elements", followed by the cooking instructions in an ordered list using the "<ol> and <li>" elements.
At the bottom of the page there is an <a href> link element that leads back to the homepage.

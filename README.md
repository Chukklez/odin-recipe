# basic-recipe-site

<h1>Basic overview</h1>
Made a basic HTML site for recipes
Made an assets folder for the picture assets that will be linked to aswell as a recipes folder for all the separate recipe webpages.
In the index webpage I linked to all the recipes in the recipe folder and put those in an unordered list so that they're in a list instead of just one after another.

<h2>Description of the recipe page layout</h2>
In the recipes pages I used the identical layout of "h1 element" for the name of the recipe followed by an "img element" who's link leads to the "assets folder". After that there's the name of recipe in a "h2 element" followed by a paragraphed description in a "p element".
Below that there are ingredients for a set number of portions in an unordered list with the "ul and li elements", followed by the cooking instructions in an ordered list using the "ol and li" elements.
At the bottom of the page there is an "a href" link element that leads back to the homepage.

<h2>What practices did I use in this project</h2>
I made use of different html pages and using the "a href" link tag to connect them all together. I also learned to structure a basic website using the html and headers, paragraphs, img links, ordered and unordered lists.
